This month, I interviews as part of the [NOAA's campaign for women's' history moth](https://research.noaa.gov/2024/03/21/meet-the-women-advancing-noaas-marine-heatwave-research/)

Here is my section!

"In her role as an assistant scientist at the Cooperative Institute for
Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic
& Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, Florida, Ana Palacio-Castro is
working to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the interplay
between different climate stressors and South Florida’s ecosystems.
These climate stressors, like ocean warming and acidification, marine
heat waves, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms, are likely to evolve
under future climate change scenarios. Ana hopes that through her work,
“we can develop more effective conservation and management strategies
that enhance climate resilience.”

Read about Ana’s hopes for the future of marine heatwave research by

change on coral reef systems, which provide a range of ecosystem
services from protecting coastlines from storms and erosion, to
recreation opportunities, to sources of food and new medicines. Recent
coral bleaching events across multiple regions, like the Caribbean and
the eastern tropical Pacific, “have underscored the urgent need for
action” Ana says. She hopes we can harness the momentum of these
devastating bleaching events to drive meaningful change and inspire
conservation efforts that are “underpinned by science-driven decision
making and inclusive, gender-responsive policies.”

Looking ahead, Ana is hopeful that we continue our commitment to climate
action and conservation, and she identifies collaborative approaches as
a key element in supporting that vision. “By fostering dialogue and
collaboration,” Ana says, “we can accelerate and upscale the
implementation of effective solutions.” Ana also believes that women
play a critical role in working towards such solutions, because women
“are not only disproportionately affected by climate change but also
[are] often at the forefront of environmental advocacy.”
