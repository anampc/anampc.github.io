## Permits

### Export: CITES permits requested by Juan Mate

### Import:

* Make sure the CITES export permit from Panama is validated before the shipment leaves the country.

* Contacted fwsole_miami@fws.gov to make them aware of the samples coming. Instructions:  
	
	-	File a 3-177 Declaration (https://edecs.fws.gov/) prior to the import
	-	As part of the declaration, upload documents (you will have to combine them in one PDF) including:
		1. scans of the CITES permits
		2. specimen list (including scientific names, quantities, and description (live)
		3. scan of the air waybill or plane ticket (is this shipment being hand carried?)
		4. a short description of the research

	-	If landing on a weekday (M-F 8:00am to 4:00pm) Customs may call us to ask if we are aware of the shipment as the person is carrying the specimens through. 
	- 	If the shipment is outside of normal working hours, we may have to contact Customs to let them know to expect the shipment and the shipment will be assigned to the overtime inspector. 
	-	The original permits will need to be submitted to our office and then the declaration will be cleared in the computer. 
		You may either bring them into the office or send them through a reliable service such as FedEx with a tracking number.
	-	The management authority or Customs will sign off on the bottom portion of the permit and validate the number of animals being exported. 

At least 48 hours in advance, please email us again to remind us of the shipment as we require a 48-Hour Notice of any live or perishable imports.
