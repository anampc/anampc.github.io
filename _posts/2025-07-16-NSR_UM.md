A new [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-06322-0) by
scientists at AOML and the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute
for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences
[(CIMAS)](https://cimas.earth.miami.edu/) revealed a surprising
discovery in the fight against one of the most destructive coral
diseases in the Atlantic and Caribbean: high sea surface temperatures
may slow down the spread of Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD).

First reported off the coast of Miami in 2014, SCTLD has since
devastated coral reefs across the Florida Keys, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and
parts of Latin America. The disease rapidly strips corals of their
tissue, leaving behind bare skeletons. Despite intensive investigation,
the exact cause of SCTLD remains unknown. However, environmental
factors—such as ocean warming and nutrient pollution—are believed to
influence its progression {% cite PalacioCastro2025_SCTLD %}.
