      Dissertation: Abiotic controls on endosymbiotic algal communities and their implications for coral bleaching susceptibility and recovery. 
      Advisor: Andrew C. Baker
      description:
        - Implemented field and laboratory experiments to understand the mechanisms underlying differential coral bleaching susceptibility.
        - Identified dynamic changes in Symbiodiniaceae communities during heat stress and recovery using qPCR.
        - Tested what coral species increase their temperature tolerance through the acquisition of thermotolerant symbionts during natural bleaching events in Florida and Panama.
        - Assessed the effect of elevated nutrients and CO2 on pre-bleaching symbiont communities and further bleaching susceptibility.
