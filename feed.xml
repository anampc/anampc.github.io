These climate stressors, like ocean warming and acidification, marine heat waves, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms, are likely to evolve under future climate change scenarios. Ana hopes that through her work, “we can develop more effective conservation and management strategies that enhance climate resilience.”</p> <p>Read about Ana’s hopes for the future of marine heatwave research by clicking here. Ana is committed to understanding the impacts of climate change on coral reef systems, which provide a range of ecosystem services from protecting coastlines from storms and erosion, to recreation opportunities, to sources of food and new medicines. Recent coral bleaching events across multiple regions, like the Caribbean and the eastern tropical Pacific, “have underscored the urgent need for action” Ana says. She hopes we can harness the momentum of these devastating bleaching events to drive meaningful change and inspire conservation efforts that are “underpinned by science-driven decision making and inclusive, gender-responsive policies.”</p> <p>Looking ahead, Ana is hopeful that we continue our commitment to climate action and conservation, and she identifies collaborative approaches as a key element in supporting that vision. “By fostering dialogue and collaboration,” Ana says, “we can accelerate and upscale the implementation of effective solutions.” Ana also believes that women play a critical role in working towards such solutions, because women “are not only disproportionately affected by climate change but also [are] often at the forefront of environmental advocacy.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Pacific corals and SCTLD</title><link href="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/Pocillopora_notebook/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pacific corals and SCTLD"/><published>2024-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/Pocillopora_notebook</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/Pocillopora_notebook/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="coral-collection">Coral collection</h2> <p>Colonies were collected by Juan Mate and collaborators and brought to the STRI in <a href="https://stri.si.edu/facility/naos">NAOS</a></p> <ul> <li>Porites lobata: 6 colonies collected on February 26, 2024</li> <li>Pocillopora: 10 colonies collected on March 1, 2024</li> <li>Pavona clavus: 7 colonies collected on March 7, 2024</li> </ul> <p>/Users/pachacuti/Documents/GitHub/anampc.github.io/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Plob" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Plob" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/notebooks/Panama_SCTLD/Plob_3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Plob" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Pdam not looking so good on March 21.

During college, I first used proprietary programs for statistical analysis. The learning curve was not so steep, but replicating the analyses became difficult after changing computers or losing access to the software licences (They were quite expensive for a student!). Additionally, using these programs became more difficult when I changed my operating system to a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU/Linux</a> distribution that was more according to my <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">philosophy</a>.</p> <p>​I finally decided to stop being scared of R and tried it during my first year in grad school. Yes, it took me more time to learn how to start using it, but now I cannot go back to any other software for my statistical analyses and graphics. R has thousands of packages, so you have almost limitless options.</p> <p>R also makes it easier to do reproducible and open science. It is free, runs on UNIX, Windows and MacOS, and if you are good keeping scripts that are well documented and organized, anyone could reproduce and validate your analyses! I personally like the R (for statistics and graphics), Markdown (for nice code documentation), git (for version control) and GitHub (for hosting/sharing/collaboration) combo.</p> <p>I found that learning R and the nuances of its packages was easier when I was running my own analysis. I suggest to get familiar with the basics and then jump into your own work even if it seems complicated.</p> <p>​ Here are some useful links and materials to get started:</p> <p><strong>R</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/">R manuals</a> in multiple languages</p> </li> <li> <p>R studio offers a graphical user interface</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R packages</a> will help you to develop good R coding practices.
