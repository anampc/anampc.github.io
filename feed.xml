These climate stressors, like ocean warming and acidification, marine heat waves, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms, are likely to evolve under future climate change scenarios. Ana hopes that through her work, “we can develop more effective conservation and management strategies that enhance climate resilience.”</p> <p>Read about Ana’s hopes for the future of marine heatwave research by clicking here. Ana is committed to understanding the impacts of climate change on coral reef systems, which provide a range of ecosystem services from protecting coastlines from storms and erosion, to recreation opportunities, to sources of food and new medicines. Recent coral bleaching events across multiple regions, like the Caribbean and the eastern tropical Pacific, “have underscored the urgent need for action” Ana says. She hopes we can harness the momentum of these devastating bleaching events to drive meaningful change and inspire conservation efforts that are “underpinned by science-driven decision making and inclusive, gender-responsive policies.”</p> <p>Looking ahead, Ana is hopeful that we continue our commitment to climate action and conservation, and she identifies collaborative approaches as a key element in supporting that vision. “By fostering dialogue and collaboration,” Ana says, “we can accelerate and upscale the implementation of effective solutions.” Ana also believes that women play a critical role in working towards such solutions, because women “are not only disproportionately affected by climate change but also [are] often at the forefront of environmental advocacy.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="outreach"/><category term="climate-change"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This month, I participated of the NOAA’s campaign for women’s’ history moth]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Study demonstrates buffering of some Florida reefs Against OA</title><link href="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/GBC_AOML/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Study demonstrates buffering of some Florida reefs Against OA"/><published>2024-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/GBC_AOML</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/GBC_AOML/"><![CDATA[<p>A groundbreaking new study spanning more than a decade and hundreds of miles of the Florida Coral Reef demonstrates the key role benthic communities play in reducing the impacts of climate change on coral reef ecosystems, specifically Ocean Acidification.</p> <p>As the ocean accumulates more carbon from the atmosphere, it becomes more acidic, a process known as Ocean Acidification. A more acidic ocean makes it harder for corals and other marine organisms to build their calcium carbonate skeletons and shells. However, scientists at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) have found that ocean acidification near the Florida Coral Reef varies both geographically and over time, resulting in reef areas that may be less affected by acidification compared to reefs in the open ocean. <a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/study-demonstrates-buffering-of-florida-reefs-against-ocean-acidification/">Continue reading</a></p> <p>Open access publication <a class="citation" href="#palacio2023coral">(Palacio-Castro et al., 2023)</a>.</p> <div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🪸Do you want to know more about how the carbonate chemistry of the Florida reef changes in time and space? 🪸... then check out our recent paper 🧐 <a href="https://t.co/pzp670BnhU">https://t.co/pzp670BnhU</a> <a href="https://t.co/J1h82aOEsA">pic.twitter.com/J1h82aOEsA</a></p>&mdash; Ana Palacio (@AnaPalacio_C) <a href="https://twitter.com/AnaPalacio_C/status/1739699400069333058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div>]]></content><author><name>AOML Communications</name></author><category term="outreach"/><category term="research"/><category term="climate-change"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A groundbreaking new study spanning more than a decade and hundreds of miles of the Florida Coral Reef demonstrates the key role benthic communities play in reducing the impacts of climate change on coral reef ecosystems, specifically Ocean Acidification.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">South Florida’s nearshore reefs less vulnerable to OA</title><link href="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/GBC_UM/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="South Florida’s nearshore reefs less vulnerable to OA"/><published>2024-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/GBC_UM</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2024/GBC_UM/"><![CDATA[<p>Researchers studying South Florida’s coral reefs found that the region’s nearshore reefs and more sheltered inshore areas are less vulnerable to ocean acidification than previously thought – a major climate-related threat to coral reefs as ocean waters absorb more atmospheric CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels.</p> <p>This new study, led by scientists at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), offers a glimmer of hope for Florida’s iconic coral reefs as ocean acidification, along with marine heat waves and other climate-related threats are impacting coral reefs worldwide. <a href="https://news.miami.edu/rosenstiel/stories/2024/01/south-floridas-nearshore-reefs-less-vulnerable-to-ocean-acidification-study-finds.html">Continue reading</a></p> <p>Related publications <a class="citation" href="#palacio2023coral">(Palacio-Castro et al., 2023)</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Annie Reisewitz</name></author><category term="outreach"/><category term="climate-change"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers studying South Florida’s coral reefs found that the region’s nearshore reefs and more sheltered inshore areas are less vulnerable to ocean acidification than previously thought – a major climate-related threat to coral reefs as ocean waters absorb more atmospheric CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Academic resources</title><link href="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2020/Academic-resources/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Academic resources"/><published>2020-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://anampc.github.io/blog/2020/Academic-resources</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2020/Academic-resources/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="find-and-write-protocols">Find and write protocols</h2> <p><a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a>: A secure platform for developing and sharing reproducible methods</p> <h2 id="paper-access">Paper access</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a> (database and browser extension): links to full-text articles from open-access sources.

During college, I first used proprietary programs for statistical analysis. The learning curve was not so steep, but replicating the analyses became difficult after changing computers or losing access to the software licences (They were quite expensive for a student!). Additionally, using these programs became more difficult when I changed my operating system to a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU/Linux</a> distribution that was more according to my <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">philosophy</a>.</p> <p>​I finally decided to stop being scared of R and tried it during my first year in grad school. Yes, it took me more time to learn how to start using it, but now I cannot go back to any other software for my statistical analyses and graphics. R has thousands of packages, so you have almost limitless options.</p> <p>R also makes it easier to do reproducible and open science. It is free, runs on UNIX, Windows and MacOS, and if you are good keeping scripts that are well documented and organized, anyone could reproduce and validate your analyses! I personally like the R (for statistics and graphics), Markdown (for nice code documentation), git (for version control) and GitHub (for hosting/sharing/collaboration) combo.</p> <p>I found that learning R and the nuances of its packages was easier when I was running my own analysis. I suggest to get familiar with the basics and then jump into your own work even if it seems complicated.</p> <p>​ Here are some useful links and materials to get started:</p> <p><strong>R</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/">R manuals</a> in multiple languages</p> </li> <li> <p>R studio offers a graphical user interface</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R packages</a> will help you to develop good R coding practices.

During college, I first used proprietary programs for statistical analysis. The learning curve was not so steep, but replicating the analyses became difficult after changing computers or losing access to the software licences (They were quite expensive for a student!). Additionally, using these programs became more difficult when I changed my operating system to a GNU/Linux distribution that was more according to my philosophy.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blanqueamiento coralino - Una amenaza inminente para el planeta</title><link href="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2017/ONU_radio/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blanqueamiento coralino - Una amenaza inminente para el planeta"/><published>2017-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://anampc.github.io/blog/2017/ONU_radio</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://anampc.github.io/blog/2017/ONU_radio/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://news.un.org/es/audio/2017/01/1419031">Coral bleaching: An imminent threat to the planet</a> is a short radio interview I did for UN radio (only in Spanish) about the significance of the study “Local-scale projections of coral reef futures and implications of the Paris Agreement “ by Ruben van Hooidonk et al.
