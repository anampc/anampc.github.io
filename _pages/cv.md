description: I am an Assistant Scientist at the Cooperative Institute
for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA’s Atlantic
Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML). My focus of research
has been how ocean warming, acidification, diseases, and land‐based
sources of pollution affect corals and disrupt the coral-algal
symbiosis, causing coral bleaching and mortality. I also investigate
environmental and genetic factors that enhance coral resilience in the
face of multiple stressors and rapid environmental changes. I use a
combination of fieldata, controlled laboratory experiments and molecular
techniques to understand corals’ susceptibility and tolerance to these
stressors.
