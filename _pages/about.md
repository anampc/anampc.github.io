Hi, I'm Ana. I am a biologist interested in the future of our oceans. My main focus of research has been how ocean warming, acidification, diseases, and pollution affect corals and disrupt the coral-algal symbiosis, causing coral bleaching and mortality. I am also trying to identify (environmental and genetic) factors that promote more resistant corals that could survive in our fast changing world.


I use a combination of fieldwork and laboratory experiments to better understand corals' susceptibility and tolerance to these stressors. I collect small coral samples during my expeditions and experiments, which then I analyze with molecular techniques and bioinformatic tools.

I am currently an Assistant Scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies [(CIMAS)](https://cimas.earth.miami.edu/) and NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory [(AOML)](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/people/ana-maria-palacio/). I got a Ph.D. from the University of Miami with the [Coral Futures Lab](https://coralreeffutures.earth.miami.edu/people/lab-alumni/ana-palacio/index.html), and a B.S. degree from Universidad de Antioquia (Colombia). I am also a member of the [Coral Reefs Ecology research group](https://arrecifes.correounivalle.edu.co/integrantes-del-grupo) at Universidad del Valle.
